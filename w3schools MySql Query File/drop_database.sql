-- The DROP DATABASE statement is used to drop an existing SQL database.
-- Be careful before dropping a database. Deleting a database will result
-- in loss of complete information stored in the database!
-- The following SQL statement drops the existing database "testDB":
-- DROP DATABASE testDB;

-- Make sure you have admin privilege before dropping any database. Once a database 
-- is dropped, you can check it in the list of databases with the following SQL command: 
-- SHOW DATABASES;
